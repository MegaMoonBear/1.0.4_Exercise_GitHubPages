# Meghan's HTML Day 1 Blog

HTML basic structure are a tag. In HTML, the "less than" (<) and "greater than" (>) symbols are called **angle brackets**. Tags have angle brackets around a letter, abbreviation, keyword, phrase, etc.

HTML mostly consists of paired tags. For example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p> with <p> as an **opening tag** and </p> as a **closing tag**. 
All pairs, unless noted. And close of pair has forward slash between the angle bracket and the tag or keyword - second for head, body, and html. 

One more useful set of syntax is for a comment. Add angle brackets before the exclamation point *and after the second set of dashes*. !-- This is a comment -->

###Most simple structure
